# Folder Structure

> This documentation only supports base template structure, New templates will be support in future.

## Pages Folder

Pages folder is one of the most important folder as it acts as views folder in `express` server, It contains all pages which will be served on the backend. As `@zarejs/cli` supports file base routing the file/folder names will be converted to route names, e.g.

- `pages/index.zare` -> `/`
- `pages/about.zare` -> `/about`
- `pages/blog/[id].zare` -> `/blog/:id`
- `pages/404.zare` -> `404 Not found` page

It is important to name your pages folder as `Pages`, But you can modify this settings in zare configurations file. see [this](configuration.mdx#pages---folder-path)

## Components Folder

This is a convention that you must declare all your components like `navbar.zare` or `footer.zare` in the `./components` folder of root, But you can name it anything.

## Static Folder

Static folder contains all static files, e.g. `style.css`, `main.js` and `favicon.ico`. It is also important to name your folder as `static`, But you can change this settings from zare configurations
