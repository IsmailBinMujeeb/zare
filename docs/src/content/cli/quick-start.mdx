> Start using Zare CLI to build Zare websites without setting up the backend server

## Installation

### Global Installation

```

## About Zare CLI

`@zarejs/cli` is an official, open source command line interface for creating, building and serving the Zare template engine code without setting up a backend server.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js on your machine, for more information visit https://nodejs.org/
2. NPM or any package manager (e.g. `yarn`, `pnpm`) should be installed

## Useful Commands

### Creating A New Project

#### Using `npx`

```bash
npx zare init myapp
```

#### Using `zare`

> If you have installed `@zarejs/cli` globally.

```bash
zare init myapp
```

Hit enter and it will create a new directory where required files and folders were setup

### Adding Dependencies

```bash
npx zare add Button
```

This command will add `Button` component from `ZareUI` (IsmailBinMujeeb/zare/main). You can also add dependencies from other github projects.

#### I DON'T LIKE ZAREUI

```bash
npx zare add Button USERNAME/REPO/BRANCH [projectDir]
```

It will add `Button` as a dependency from specified github project. And last option is project path which is "." by default.

### Start Serving

```bash
npx zare serve myapp
```

This start a local `express` server, `myapp` is should be a valid project directory path which contains `pages` folder and `zare config file`.

### Build `HTML`

```bash
npx zare build myapp
```

This will build the static `html` files from your zare `files`.
