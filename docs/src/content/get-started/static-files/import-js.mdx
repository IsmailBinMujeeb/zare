## Overview

The importing js in **Zare** is refer to adding a script tag in your header with `src` and `defer`. The importing js is same as linking the css just a keyword changed.

## Syntax

```zare
import "/js/nav.js"
```

- The `import` keyword tells the `parser` that a vanilla js is imported and its path is `“/js/nav.js“`.

- The `“/js/nav.js“` which is the path to your vanilla js, kindly refer [this](static-files) to understand static files.

## Import in Component Files

It is also possible to import js in your component files directly so that when ever you import your component the vanilla js will be imported with it.

```zare fulename="/views/component/footer"
import "/js/footer.js"

serve (
    <footer>This is a Footer</footer>
)
```

Now when ever you import this footer component in your pages the footer js will imported automatically in your head tag.
