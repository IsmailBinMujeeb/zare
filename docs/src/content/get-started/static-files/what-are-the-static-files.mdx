title: What Are The Static Files
---
## Overview

**Static files** are files that do not change dynamically when a web server runs.\
They are delivered to the client exactly as they are stored, without any server-side processing.

Common types of static files include:

* HTML files

* CSS files

* JavaScript files

* Images (JPG, PNG, SVG, etc.)

* Fonts (TTF, WOFF, etc.)

* Videos and other media files

## Purpose

Static files are essential for:

* Structuring the webpage (HTML)

* Styling the webpage (CSS)

* Adding client-side interactivity (JavaScript)

* Displaying media (images, videos, fonts)

They improve performance by reducing server processing and are often cached by browsers for faster loading.

## Usage

### In Web Servers

Most web frameworks and servers provide mechanisms to serve static files.\
You typically configure a directory (folder) where static assets are stored and make it accessible to the public.

Example (generic):

```plaintext
/static
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles/
    │   └── style.css
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── app.js
    └── images/
        └── logo.png
```

### Important Points

* Static files are served *as-is*, with no changes at runtime.

* Efficient caching strategies can be applied to static files.

* They are usually placed in a separate directory like `static/`, `public/`, or `assets/`.

## Example (Node.js with Express)

```javascript filename="index.js"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the "public" folder
app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

In this case, files inside the `public/` folder can be accessed directly from the browser.

## Best Practices

* **Organize** static files into subfolders (e.g., CSS, JS, images).

* **Compress** files (e.g., minify CSS and JS) for faster load times.

* **Use caching** headers to allow browsers to store static files.

* **Secure** the static file serving to prevent access to sensitive files.

## Conclusion

Static files are a fundamental part of web development, providing the building blocks for creating responsive and visually appealing websites. Proper management of static files leads to improved performance and a better user experience.
