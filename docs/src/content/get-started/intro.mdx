## Installation

1. NPM

   ```bash
   npm i zare
   ```

2. YARN

   ```bash
   yarn add zare
   ```

## Express Setup

```javascript copy=true filename="index.js"
import express from 'express'; // Make sure you have express downloaded from npm or yarn

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000; // Our server will be running at port 3000

app.set('view engine', 'zare'); // zare package must be install.

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index');
});

app.listen(PORT);
```

## Writing your first Zare file

create a file in views folder and name it index.zare.

```zare filename="view/index.zare"
serve (
    <h1>Hello, Zare</h1>
)
```

ğŸ’Œ: Since `v2` we have made big changes in the core engine and continuously new releases are coming, for future **Zare developers** we suggest to use as latest version as you can use.
