# Structure Of Zare Files

The structure of any zare file is divided into two parts.

1. Partials

   - It includes importing the components, statics files etc

2. serve

   - It serves the HTML logic that will be converted to HTML

## Partials

In the section you can import your components and static files like `CSS` and `vanilla JavaScript`.

### Example

```zare filename="index.zare"
as Card import "./components/Card" # Component importing
link PageCss "/stylesheets/style.css" # Link's css
import PageJs "/javascripts/main.js" # Import's Vanilla Js
```

The partial section only provides this keywords:

- `as` To declare a component

- `import` Has two use case, to import component and to add script tag in your final `HTML`

- `link` is used to add link tag in your final `HTML`

## Serve

The serve section is the main executor for your code. It contains the HTML plus Logic eg, If, Else, Function calls and Each loop.

### Example

```zare filename="index.zare"
serve (
    @if (1 == 1) {
        <h1>The 1 is equal to 1</h1>
    } @else {
        <h1>1 is not equal to 1</h1>
    }
)
```

The above code is an example of if else statements in zare templating, Also thing to mark is that the keywords used in serve block must start with `@`.

- `@if`

- `@else`

- `@each`

## Conclusion

After describing the both sections the final structure on a single file will look like

```zare filename="index.zare"
as Card import "./components/Card" # Component importing
link PageCss "/stylesheets/style.css" # Link's css
import PageJs "/javascripts/main.js" # Import's Vanilla Js

serve (
    @if (1 == 1) {
        <h1>The 1 is equal to 1</h1>
    } @else {
        <h1>1 is not equal to 1</h1>
    }
)
```
